    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Really simple, really quick, delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano or thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220°C (200°C fan).</li>
        <li>Pound chicken to 1.5cm at the thickest part – using a rolling pin, meat mallet or even your fist (key tip for even cooking + tender chicken).</li>
        <li>Mix Seasoning.</li>
        <li>Line tray with foil and baking / parchment paper. Place chicken upside down on tray. Drizzle chicken with about 1 tsp oil. Rub over with fingers. Sprinkle with Seasoning.</li>
        <li>Flip chicken. Drizzle with 1 tsp oil, rub with fingers, sprinkle with Seasoning, covering as much of the surface area as you can.</li>
        <li>Bake 18 minutes, or until surface is golden per photos and video, or internal temperature is 165°F/75°C using a meat thermometer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and immediately transfer chicken to serving plates.</li>
        <li>Wait 3 – 5 minutes before serving, garnished with freshly chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
